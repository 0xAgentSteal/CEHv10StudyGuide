# Scanning and Enumeration

**Scanning** - discovering systems on the network and looking at what ports are open as well as applications that may be running

**Connectionless Communication** - UDP packets are sent without creating a connection.  Examples are TFTP, DNS (lookups only) and DHCP

**Connection-Oriented Communication** - TCP packets require a connection due to the size of the data being transmitted and to ensure deliverability

### <u>TCP Flags</u>

| Flag | Name           | Function                                                     |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN  | Synchronize    | Set during initial communication.  Negotiating of parameters and sequence numbers |
| ACK  | Acknowledgment | Set as an acknowledgement to the SYN flag.  Always set after initial SYN |
| RST  | Reset          | Forces the termination of a connection (in both directions)  |
| FIN  | Finish         | Ordered close to communications                              |
| PSH  | Push           | Forces the delivery of data without concern for buffering    |
| URG  | Urgent         | Data inside is being sent out of band.  Example is cancelling a message |

### <u>TCP Handshake</u>

- SYN -> SYN-ACK - ACK
- Sequence numbers increase on new communication.  Example is computers A and B.  A would increment B's sequence number.  A would never increment it's own sequence.

### <u>Port Numbers</u>

- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (IANA) - maintains Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry which lists all port number reservations

- Ranges

  - **Well-known ports** - 0 - 1023

  - **Registered ports** - 1024 - 49,151

  - **Dynamic ports** - 49,152 - 65,535

    | Port Number | Protocol | Transport Protocol |
    | ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
    | 20/21       | FTP      | TCP                |
    | 22          | SSH      | TCP                |
    | 23          | Telnet   | TCP                |
    | 25          | SMTP     | TCP                |
    | 53          | DNS      | TCP/UDP            |
    | 67          | DHCP     | UDP                |
    | 69          | TFTP     | UDP                |
    | 80          | HTTP     | TCP                |
    | 110         | POP3     | TCP                |
    | 135         | RPC      | TCP                |
    | 137-139     | NetBIOS  | TCP/UDP            |
    | 143         | IMAP     | TCP                |
    | 161/162     | SNMP     | UDP                |
    | 389         | LDAP     | TCP/UDP            |
    | 443         | HTTPS    | TCP                |
    | 445         | SMB      | TCP                |

  - A service is said to be **listening** for a port when it has that specific port open

  - Once a service has made a connection, the port is in an **established** state

  - Netstat

    - Shows open ports on computer
    - **netstat -an** displays connections in numerical form
    - **netstat -b** displays executables tied to the open port (admin only)

### <u>Subnetting</u>

- **IPv4 Main Address Types**
  - **Unicast** - acted on by a single recipient
  - **Multicast** - acted on by members of a specific group
  - **Broadcast** - acted on by everyone on the network
    - **Limited** - delivered to every system in the domain (255.255.255.255)
    - **Directed** - delivered to all devices on a subnet and use that broadcast address
- **Subnet mask** - determines how many address available on a specific subnet
  - Represented by three methods
    - **Decimal** - 255.240.0.0
    - **Binary** - 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
    - **CIDR** - x.x.x.x/12   (where x.x.x.x is an ip address on that range)
  - If all the bits in the host field are 1s, the address is the broadcast
  - If they are all 0s, it's the network address
  - Any other combination indicates an address in the range

### <u>Scanning Methodology</u>

- **Check for live systems** - ping or other type of way to determine live hosts
- **Check for open ports** - once you know live host IPs, scan them for listening ports
- **Scan beyond IDS** - if needed, use methods to scan  beyond the detection systems
- **Perform banner grabbing** - grab from servers as well as perform OS fingerprinting
- **Scan for vulnerabilities** - use tools to look at the vulnerabilities of open systems
- **Draw network diagrams** - shows logical and physical pathways into networks
- **Prepare proxies** - obscures efforts to keep you hidden
